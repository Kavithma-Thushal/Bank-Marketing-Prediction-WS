# 💰 Bank Marketing Prediction (Machine Learning) 💰

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit
based on various attributes in the bank marketing dataset. The model was created using a Jupyter Notebook and involves
preprocessing the data, feature engineering, training different classification models, and evaluating their performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

✅ Python  
✅ NumPy  
✅ Pandas  
✅ Scikit-learn  
✅ Matplotlib  
✅ Seaborn  
✅ Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Learning Objectives

✅ Understanding the basics of machine learning and classification models.  
✅ Preprocessing data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling).  
✅ Using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) models for prediction.  
✅ Evaluating model performance with classification metrics.  
✅ Visualizing data distributions and model evaluation metrics.
